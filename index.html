        The coronavirus and racial pandemics are clarion calls for the need to
        create a robust health care system for all. This forum focuses on the
        leadership required to successfully navigate these tumultuous times and
        build an effective health system with public and private stakeholders
        aligned to address disparities and health inequities. Other forum
        highlights include a special legislative, regulatory and member update
        from Rick Pollack and AHAâ€™s executive team, as well as election insights
        and post-election scenarios. This special invitation-only leadership
        event has been designed specifically for AHA health system presidents
        and CEOs
